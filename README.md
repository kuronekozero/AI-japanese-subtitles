# AI Subtitles Repository

This repository contains a collection of high-quality AI-generated subtitles that I have created for personal use to watch anime, YouTube videos, and streams. New subtitles are uploaded when I find something new and interesting to watch.

## Subtitle Generation Process

All subtitles in this repository are created using the largest model of **Faster-Whisper** in conjunction with **SubPlz**.

I use SubPlz for subtitle generation because of its accuracy and precise timestamps, which I have found to be the most effective method for generating Japanese subtitles. For optimal quality, I use the "large" model on a PC with an NVIDIA RTX 4070.

### Contribution

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your contributions.
3.  **Navigate to the `subtitles/` directory**. Create a new folder named after the content creator or series. 
4.  **Add your subtitle files** to this new folder. Ensure your files are named just like the origin videos' names(in case this is youtube videos).
5.  **Commit and push** your changes to your forked repository.
6.  **Open a pull request** from your branch to the main branch of this repository.

### Quality Guidelines

For consistency and quality, I highly recommend that all contributed subtitles are generated using **SubPlz** with the **`large` model**. This ensures that all subtitles maintain the same high level of accuracy and precise timestamps as the existing files in the repository.
