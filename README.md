# AI Subtitles Repository

This repository contains a collection of high-quality AI-generated subtitles that I have created for personal use to watch anime, YouTube videos, and streams. New subtitles are uploaded when I find something new and interesting to watch.

## Subtitle Generation Process

All subtitles in this repository are created using the largest model of **Faster-Whisper** in conjunction with **SubPlz**.

I use SubPlz for subtitle generation because of its accuracy and precise timestamps, which I have found to be the most effective method for generating Japanese subtitles. For optimal quality, I use the "large" model on a PC with an NVIDIA RTX 4070.
